1)  In the Main class, write a static method getThirdLetterOfAlphabet that returns the third letter of the alphabet as a char in lower case.

2)  In the Main class, write a static method rememberQuoting that returns: 
                 I remember "quoting" from last year!

The following all take place in the Employee class:

3) Write a method called getLastInitial that returns the first letter of the last name of the employee as a char. (Your method should take no parameters.)

4) Write a method called hasDoubleName that returns true if the first and last names are the same, and returns false otherwise.

5) Write a method called getNameLength that returns the total length of the employee's name including first name, middleInitial and lastName.

6)  Write a method called getFullName that returns a single string: the first name, followed by a space, followed by the middle initial and a period, followed by another space, and finally the last name but all in upper case.

7)  Write a method called getMonogram that returns a three-letter string containing the first initial, followed by the middle initial, followed by the last initial but all in lower case.

8)  Write a method called setMiddleInitial that takes a char parameter and stores the uppercase version of that character as the middle initial for this Employee. But if the parameter is not a letter at all, ignore it and leave the current middle initial alone. IMPORTANT:  Do NOT use String methods.  Use Character methods.
